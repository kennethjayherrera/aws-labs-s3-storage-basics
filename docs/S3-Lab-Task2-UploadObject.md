## **Task 2: Upload an Object to the Bucket**

### **Objective**
Upload a sample file to your S3 bucket to understand object storage and metadata.

### **Steps**
1. Open your created bucket.
2. Click **Upload** → **Add files**.
3. Select a file from your local computer (e.g., `sample.txt`).
4. Click **Upload**.

### **Key Learning**
You learned that:
- S3 objects can include files of any type.
- Each object can have metadata and unique permissions.
- Uploading doesn’t automatically make objects public.
