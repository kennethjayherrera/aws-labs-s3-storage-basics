## **Task 1: Create a Bucket**

### **Objective**
Create a new S3 bucket to store data and learn basic configuration options such as region selection, bucket naming, and permissions.

### **Steps**
1. Log in to your AWS Management Console.
2. Navigate to **S3** service.
3. Click **Create bucket**.
4. Enter a unique **Bucket name** (e.g., `my-lab-storage-bucket`).
5. Choose your preferred **AWS Region** (same region as your EC2 instance for cost efficiency and faster access).
6. Leave other settings as default for now.
7. Click **Create bucket**.

### **Key Learning**
You learned that:
- Bucket names must be globally unique across AWS.
- Region choice affects latency and data compliance.
- Default settings provide private access by default (secure configuration).
