# AWS S3 Storage Basics Lab

This lab demonstrates the end-to-end setup of **Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service)** with **IAM Role** and **Bucket Policy** configuration to manage secure access control.  
It is part of my hands-on learning for **AWS Cloud Practitioner Essentials** and **CompTIA Security+** preparation.

---

## 🧠 Learning Objectives
- Create and configure an S3 bucket
- Understand IAM roles and policies
- Apply a bucket policy for secure access
- Upload and manage objects in S3

## 🧾 Summary of Learnings
- S3 provides scalable object storage for cloud workloads.
- IAM manages **who** has access (identity-based control).
- Bucket policies define **what resources** they can access (resource-based control).
- Combining both ensures secure and auditable access control.
